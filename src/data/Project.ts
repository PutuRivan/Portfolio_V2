For this purpose, I utilized the Jikan.moe API to retrieve data related to manga. The project aims to provide users with an easy and informative experience in exploring manga lists. By leveraging the API, users can search for manga, view detailed information, and explore related data through a simple yet engaging interface. Mangalist showcases practical implementation of API integration to enhance the functionality of a web-based platform.",
